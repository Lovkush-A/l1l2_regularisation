# l1l2_regularisation
Creating visualisations to understand the difference between L1 and L2 regularisation.

The two gif files show how the optimal parameters (the red dot) changes as we change the cost function (represented by the contour plot), and where the parameters are restricted to be within an L1-ball or L2-ball.

We can see that the L1-ball forces one of the parameters to zero for most of the cost functions, unlike the L2-ball where there is no preference for zero or non-zero parameters.
